# Paytouch

Assumptions:
- If user submits empty search inputs (the original form when the search screen is initialised), the app will show the original list of actors.
- Order function applies on the appeared list (original list or searched list).

Time spent
- Actor list screen : 5hrs
- Actor detail screen: 1hr
- Search screen : 2hrs

Difficulties
- UI customisation such as the order drop-down menu, search screen and actor detail popup.

Things that can be improved
- Use database to store and synchronise the fetched data from the API. It can reduce loading time and also help on searching and filtering easily.
